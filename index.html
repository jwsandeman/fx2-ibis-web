          In just a few decades, the Australian white ibis (Threskiornis
          molucca) has made itself at home in many of Australia's coastal and
          inland cities. And aside from the feathered birds we see daily (often
          foraging amongst garbage), representations of ibis have exploded in
          popular culture. The humble ibis, it seems, has gone viral.

          Ibis have entered the Australian English lexicon as "bin chickens",
          "tip turkeys", "sandwich snatchers" and "picnic pirates", to name just
          four of their many nicknames. ... In Queensland, a baker recently made
          a cake depicting an ibis eating out of a garbage can commissioned for
          a 21st birthday.

          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
          industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
          since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
          five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
          remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
          the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
          more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
          including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
